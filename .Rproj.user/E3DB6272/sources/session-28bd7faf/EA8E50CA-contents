```{r}
library(readxl)
work_sheet_ <- read_excel(choose.files(), 
                          sheet = "Sheet1", col_types = c("numeric", 
                                                          "numeric", "numeric", "numeric",

                                                          "numeric", "numeric"), na = "62", 
                          n_max = 72)# link to the excel file we use here
```


```{r}
View(work_sheet_)# here we use to see the excel file 

dim(work_sheet_)# to check the dim or the rows and colomms

head(work_sheet_)# here we see the first six observation of the data
tail(work_sheet_)# here we see the last six observation of the data 

is.na(work_sheet_)# to check the observatin that are not in the data

# here we see the discriptive statistics of the data set
```

## Here we see the discriptive statistics of the data set



```{r}
summary(work_sheet_$Year)
summary(work_sheet_$Population)
summary(work_sheet_$`labour force`)
summary(work_sheet_$population_percent)
summary(work_sheet_$employed_total)
summary(work_sheet_$`employed percent`)
summary(work_sheet_$`agriculture ratio`)
summary(work_sheet_$non_agriculture_ratio)
summary(work_sheet_$not_in_labour)
```

## Histogram of the data set

```{r}


hist(work_sheet_$Year)
hist(work_sheet_$Population)
hist(work_sheet_$`labour force`)
hist(work_sheet_$population_percent)
hist(work_sheet_$employed_total)
hist(work_sheet_$`employed percent`)

```



## Corr Plot
```{r}


#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot) # load the corrplot package
```



## fit a logistic regression model to predict species based on petal length and width
```{r}

#model <- glm(Year ~ Population + employed_total,
#             data = work_sheet_,family="binomial")
```


## Summarize the model
```{r}

#summary(model)
```




##- we find the anova of for the analysis

# Perform ANOVA analysis


```{r}
my_anova <- aov(work_sheet_$Year ~ work_sheet_$Population+
                  work_sheet_$`labour force` , data=work_sheet_)

```



# Print ANOVA table
```{r}

summary(my_anova)
```
##  3- asymmetry of the data set






```{r}
#intall.packages("moments")
library(moments)

skewness(work_sheet_)
```


## 4- now we check the concentration of the data set

The concept of concentration is closely related to the concepts 
of variance and standard deviation. A distribution with high 
concentration has a low variance or standard deviation, meaning 
that the values are clustered tightly around the mean. In 
contrast, a distribution with low concentration has a high variance
or standard deviation, indicating that the values are more widely
spread out.
```{r}
# now the r code for it

cone_1<-mean(work_sheet_$Population)
cone_1

cone_2<-sd(work_sheet_$Population)
cone_2 
#same processes for the other variable in the data set.

```

## 5- #now the analysis of the correlation and regression

assuming your dependent variable is named "DV" and your independent variable is named "IV"
and your data is stored in a data frame named "my_data"
calculate the correlation between the two variables


```{r}
cor(work_sheet_$employed_total, work_sheet_$population_percent)
```


```{r}
# run a linear regression of DV on IV

my_lm <- lm(employed_total ~ population_percent, data = work_sheet_)
my_lm


```


```{r}
# summarize the regression results

summary(my_lm)
```
